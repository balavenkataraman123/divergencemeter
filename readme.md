# Divergence meter countdown timer

Countdown timer, but the digits are displayed on nixie tubes to look like the divergence meter from steins gate

made it while bored on a long drive (fortunately my new laptop actually has battery life, unlike my old one)

utility: ig it looks cool, nice countdown timer for someone who likes that aesthetic

usage: run timedisplay.py
enter the year, month, day, hour, minute, second
enjoy

if you want it bigger, you can add a cv2.resize

imageslice.py was used to get the images of the individual digits being displayed on the nixie tubes from the image nixietube.jpg I found online, no need to run it
